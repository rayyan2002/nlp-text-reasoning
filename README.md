GIKI NLP Text Reasoning Task
 Overview

This project was completed as part of the GIKI Full Stack AI Bootcamp 2025.
It focuses on text reasoning and NLP preprocessing — applying natural language understanding techniques to process and analyze structured text data using Python and popular NLP libraries.

The notebook demonstrates:

Text data cleaning and normalization

Tokenization and feature extraction

Simple reasoning over textual information

Basic use of pre-trained language models for understanding context

Technologies Used

Python 3.10+

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

NLTK – for text preprocessing

Hugging Face Transformers – for model inference

Scikit-learn – for tokenization and simple reasoning logic

Pandas / NumPy – for data handling

 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rayyan2002/giki-nlp-text-reasoning.git
cd giki-nlp-text-reasoning


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook M_Rayyan_Ayub_NLP_Task.ipynb


Run all cells to see preprocessing, reasoning, and evaluation steps.

 Sample Output

Cleaned and tokenized text

Extracted entities and structured reasoning examples

Small demonstration of text normalization and understanding

 Key Learning

This mini-project enhanced my understanding of how language models can perform reasoning tasks on structured text, such as unit conversions or logical text mappings — concepts closely related to LLM fine-tuning and prompt-based reasoning.
