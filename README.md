# 🧠 NLP Text Reasoning Task

This notebook was created as part of my **GIKI Full Stack AI Bootcamp 2025**, where I explored **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for text understanding and reasoning.

The goal of this mini-project was to demonstrate how simple NLP logic and transformer-based models can **analyze, clean, and reason over structured text data**, such as extracting entities, performing conversions, or identifying relationships.

---

## 🔍 What I Did
- Preprocessed raw text (tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation cleaning)
- Used **NLTK** and **Hugging Face Transformers** for text representation and model inference
- Implemented a lightweight reasoning layer to interpret relationships and contextual patterns
- Evaluated outputs to test how models perform text-based logical tasks

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLTK
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Pandas, NumPy

---

## 💡 Key Takeaway
This task strengthened my understanding of **how language models process and reason with text**, building a foundation for more advanced **LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering** work.
